	abstract = {In probabilistic environmental risk assessment, the likelihood and the extent of adverse effects occurring in ecological systems because of exposure(s) to substances are estimated. It is based on the comparison of an exposure/environmental concentration distribution, with a species sensitivity distribution derived from toxicity data. The calculation of a probabilistic risk can be performed in many ways (e.g., area under the curve in joint probability curves). However, several (hypothetical) examples and some theoretical considerations illustrate that the current risk characterisation methods have an integrative character and they focus on the statistical comparison of two distributions without properly considering the environmental interpretation of these underlying distributions. Several scenarios with varying exposure/environmental concentration distribution and species sensitivity distribution standard deviations are discussed.},

	title = {Estimation for hazardous concentrations based on {NOEC} toxicity data: an alternative approach},
	abstract = {A common task in environmental studies is to determine toxicant concentrations at which a certain proportion (typically 95 per cent) of the biological species is protected. Extrapolation techniques need to be employed for small sample sizes. By de®nition, our interest focuses on the lower tail of the NOEC (no observed eect concentration) distribution, which is very sensitive to the choice of the underlying distribution. In this paper we investigate the use of the three-parameter Burr Type III distribution because of its ¯exibility and ease-of-use. The Constrained Maximum Likelihood (CML) method was used to estimate parameters. Collinearity between parameter estimates was overcome by reparameterisation techniques. As an alternative to the computation of adjustment factors, we estimate the lower con®dence limits of percentile estimates using the Delta-method. When the NOEC sample sizes are small, we employ Bootstrapping, a computer intensive technique. Our technique is easily extended to mixtures of the three-parameter Burr type III distributions, which can be used to model multimodal distributions. Copyright \# 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
