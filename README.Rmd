`ssdtools` is an R package to fit and plot Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSD). 

SSDs are cumulative probability distributions which are fitted to toxicity concentrations for different species as described by Posthuma et al. (2001).
The ssdtools package uses Maximum Likelihood to fit distributions such as the log-normal, log-logistic, log-Gumbel (also known as the inverse Weibull), gamma, Weibull and log-normal log-normal mixture.
Multiple distributions can be averaged using Akaike Information Criteria.
Confidence intervals on hazard concentrations and proportions are produced by bootstrapping.

## Introduction

The dependency [`ssddata`](https://github.com/open-AIMS/ssddata) provides example data sets for several chemicals including Boron.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ssdtools)
ssddata::ccme_boron
```

The six default distributions are fit using `ssd_fit_dists()`

```{r}
fits <- ssd_fit_dists(ssddata::ccme_boron)
```

and can be quickly plotted using `autoplot`

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.alt="A plot of the data and fitted distributions"}
autoplot(fits)
```

The goodness of fit can be assessed using `ssd_gof`

```{r}
ssd_gof(fits)
```

and the model-averaged 5% hazard concentration estimated (with bootstrapping to get confidence intervals) using `ssd_hc`.

```{r}
set.seed(99)
hc5 <- ssd_hc(fits, ci = TRUE)
print(hc5)
```

Model-averaged predictions complete with confidence intervals can also be estimated by parametric bootstrapping using the `stats` generic `predict`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
boron_pred <- predict(fits, ci = TRUE)
```

The predictions can be plotted together with the original data using `ssd_plot`.

```{r, fig.alt="A plot of the data and model-averaged prediction with confidence intervals"}
library(ggplot2)

theme_set(theme_bw())

ssd_plot(ssddata::ccme_boron, boron_pred,
  shape = "Group", color = "Group", label = "Species",
  xlab = "Concentration (mg/L)", ribbon = TRUE
) +
  expand_limits(x = 3000) +
  scale_colour_ssd()
```
