`ssdtools` is an R package to plot and fit Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSD). 

SSDs are cumulative probability distributions which are fitted to toxicity concentrations for multiple species.
The ssdtools package uses Maximum Likelihood to fit log-normal, log-logistic, gompertz, lgumbel, gamma or weibull distributions.
Multiple distributions can be averaged using Information Criteria.
Confidence intervals on fits and hazard concentrations are produced by bootstrapping.

## Installation

To install the latest version from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ssdtools)
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ssdtools")
```

To install the latest development version:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bcgov/ssdtools")
```

To install the latest version development version and build its vignettes:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bcgov/ssdtools", force = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

To see the available vignettes
```{r, eval = FALSE}

```

## Introduction

`ssdtools` loads `fitdistrplus` and `ggplot2`, both of which it extends, as well as several other packages.
```{r}
library(ssdtools)
```

`ssdtools` provides a data set for several chemicals including Boron.
```{r}
boron_data
```

Multiple distributions can be fit using `ssd_fit_dists()`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
boron_dists <- ssd_fit_dists(boron_data)
```

and plot using the `ggplot2` generic `autoplot`
```{r, warning = FALSE}
theme_set(theme_bw()) # set plotting theme
autoplot(boron_dists)
```

The goodness of fit can be assessed using `ssd_gof`
```{r, warning = FALSE}
ssd_gof(boron_dists)
```

and the model-averaged 5% hazard concentration estimated using `ssd_hc`
```{r, warning = FALSE}
ssd_hc(boron_dists)
```

Model-averaged predictions complete with confidence intervals can be produced using the `stats` generic `predict`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
boron_pred <- predict(boron_dists)
```

and plotted together with the original data using `ssd_plot`.
```{r}
ssd_plot(boron_data, boron_pred, shape = "Group", color = "Group", label = "Species",
         xlab = "Concentration (mg/L)")
```

For more information and examples of how to use `ssdtools` in conjuction with `fitdistrplus` to assess alternative fits and deal with weighted and censored data see the vignette `ssdtools`.
The vignette also demonstrates how to use `ssdtools` in conjunction with `ggplot2` to produce custom plots.

The data included in `ssdtools` are sourced from the Canadian environmental quality guidelines [published by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment](http://ceqg-rcqe.ccme.ca/en/index.html). See the `data-raw` folder for more information.
