`ssdtools` is an R package to fit and plot Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSD). 

SSDs are cumulative probability distributions which are fitted to toxicity concentrations for different species as described by Posthuma et al. (2001).
The ssdtools package uses Maximum Likelihood to fit distributions such as the gamma, log-Gumbel (identical to inverse Weibull), log-logistic, log-normal and Weibull to censored and/or weighted data.
Multiple distributions can be averaged using Akaike Information Criteria.
Confidence intervals on hazard concentrations and proportions are produced by parametric bootstrapping.

## Installation

To install the latest version from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ssdtools)
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ssdtools")
```

To install the latest development version:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bcgov/ssdtools")
```

## Introduction

`ssdtools` provides a data set for several chemicals including Boron.
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ssdtools)
ssddata::ccme_boron
```

Distributions are fit using `ssd_fit_dists()`
```{r}
fits <- ssd_fit_dists(ssddata::ccme_boron)
```

and can be quickly plotted using `autoplot`
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

theme_set(theme_bw())

autoplot(fits) + 
  scale_colour_ssd()
```

The goodness of fit can be assessed using `ssd_gof`
```{r}
ssd_gof(fits)
```

and the model-averaged 5% hazard concentration estimated by parametric bootstrapping using `ssd_hc`
```{r}
set.seed(99)
hc5 <- ssd_hc(fits, ci = TRUE, nboot = 100) # 100 bootstrap samples for speed
print(hc5)
```

Model-averaged predictions complete with confidence intervals can also be estimated by parametric bootstrapping using the `stats` generic `predict`.
To perform bootstrapping for each distribution in parallel register the future backend
and then select the evaluation strategy.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
doFuture::registerDoFuture()
future::plan(future::multisession)

set.seed(99)
boron_pred <- predict(fits, ci = TRUE)
```

and plotted together with the original data using `ssd_plot`.
```{r}
ssd_plot(ssddata::ccme_boron, boron_pred,
  shape = "Group", color = "Group", label = "Species",
  xlab = "Concentration (mg/L)", ribbon = TRUE
) + 
  expand_limits(x = 3000) +
  scale_colour_ssd()
```
