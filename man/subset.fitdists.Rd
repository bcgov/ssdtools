\method{subset}{fitdists}(x, select = names(x), delta = Inf, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The object.}

\item{select}{A character vector of the distributions to select.}

\item{delta}{A non-negative number specifying the maximum absolute Akaike Information-theoretic Criterion difference cutoff. Distributions with an absolute difference from the best model greater than the cutoff are excluded.}

\item{...}{Unused.}

\description{
Select a subset of distributions from a fitdists object.
The Akaike Information-theoretic Criterion differences are calculated after
selecting the distributions named in select.

\examples{
fits <- ssd_fit_dists(ssddata::ccme_boron)
subset(fits, c("gamma", "lnorm"))
