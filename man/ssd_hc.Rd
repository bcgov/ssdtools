\arguments{
\item{x}{The object.}

\item{...}{Unused.}

\item{percent}{A numeric vector of percent values to estimate hazard concentrations for. Soft-deprecated for \code{proportion = 0.05}.}

\item{proportion}{A numeric vector of proportion values to estimate hazard concentrations for.}

\item{average}{A flag specifying whether to provide model averaged values as opposed to a value for each distribution.}

\item{ci}{A flag specifying whether to estimate confidence intervals (by bootstrapping).}

\item{level}{A number between 0 and 1 of the confidence level of the interval.}

\item{nboot}{A count of the number of bootstrap samples to use to estimate the confidence limits. A value of 10,000 is recommended for official guidelines.}

\item{min_pboot}{A number between 0 and 1 of the minimum
proportion of bootstrap samples that must successfully fit (return a likelihood)
to report the confidence intervals.}

\item{multi_est}{A flag specifying whether to treat the distributions as constituting a single distribution (as opposed to taking the mean) when calculating model averaged estimates.}

\item{ci_method}{A string specifying which method to use for estimating the bootstrap values.
Possible values are "multi_free" and "multi_fixed" which treat the distributions as constituting a single distribution but differ in whether the model weights are fixed and "weighted_samples" and "weighted_arithmetic" take bootstrap samples from each distribution proportional to its weight versus calculating the weighted arithmetic means of the lower and upper confidence limits.}

\item{parametric}{A flag specifying whether to perform parametric bootstrapping as opposed to non-parametrically resampling the original data with replacement.}

\item{delta}{A non-negative number specifying the maximum absolute AIC difference cutoff.
Distributions with an absolute AIC difference greater than delta are excluded from the calculations.}

\item{samples}{A flag specfying whether to include a numeric vector of the bootstrap samples as a list column in the output.}

\item{save_to}{NULL or a string specifying a directory to save where the bootstrap datasets and parameter estimates (when successfully converged) to.}

\item{control}{A list of control parameters passed to \code{\link[stats:optim]{stats::optim()}}.}
}
\value{
A tibble of corresponding hazard concentrations.

\description{
Calculates concentration(s) with bootstrap confidence intervals
that protect specified proportion(s) of species for
individual or model-averaged distributions
using parametric or non-parametric bootstrapping.
}
\details{
Model-averaged estimates and/or confidence intervals (including standard error)
can be calculated  by treating the distributions as
constituting a single mixture distribution
versus 'taking the mean'.
When calculating the model averaged estimates treating the
distributions as constituting a single mixture distribution
ensures that \code{ssd_hc()} is the inverse of \code{ssd_hp()}.

If treating the distributions as constituting a single mixture distribution
when calculating model average confidence intervals then
\code{weighted} specifies whether to use the original model weights versus
re-estimating for each bootstrap sample unless 'taking the mean' in which case
\code{weighted} specifies
whether to take bootstrap samples from each distribution proportional to
its weight (so that they sum to \code{nboot}) versus
calculating the weighted arithmetic means of the lower
and upper confidence limits based on \code{nboot} samples for each distribution.

Distributions with an absolute AIC difference greater
than a delta of by default 7 have considerably less support (weight < 0.01)
and are excluded
prior to calculation of the hazard concentrations to reduce the run time.
