abstract = {Abstract Species-sensitivity distribution methods assemble single-species toxicity data to predict hazardous concentrations (HCps) affecting a certain percentage (p) of species in a community. The fit of the lognormal model and required number of individual species values were evaluated with 30 published data sets. The increasingly common assumption that a lognormal model best fits these data was not supported. Fifteen data sets failed a formal test of conformity to a lognormal distribution; other distributions often provided better fit to the data than the lognormal distribution. An alternate bootstrap method provided accurate estimates of HCp without the assumption of a specific distribution. Approximate sample sizes producing HC5 estimates with minimal variance ranged from 15 to 55, and had a median of 30 species-sensitivity values. These sample sizes are higher than those suggested in recent regulatory documents. A bootstrap method is recommended that predicts with 95\% confidence the concentration affecting 5\% or fewer species.},

	abstract = {The species sensitivity distribution (SSD) is the most widely used method for getting water quality benchmarks to characterize effects of chemical contaminants for water quality or ecological risk assessment (Fox et al., 2020). This typically involves estimating the concentration of a chemical that affects 5\% of the species considered (Posthuma et al., 2001). The ssdtools R package (Thorley \& Schwarz, 2018) has recently advanced SSD methods by providing model averaging using information-theoretic criteria and the construction of confidence intervals using bootstrapping (Fox et al., 2020).},
