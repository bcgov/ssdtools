## How to contribute

Government employees, public and members of the private sector are
encouraged to contribute to the repository by **forking and submitting a
pull request**.

(If you are new to GitHub, you might start with a [basic
tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and check out a
more detailed guide to [pull
requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).)

Pull requests will be evaluated by the repository guardians on a
schedule and if deemed beneficial will be committed to the master.

All contributors retain the original copyright to their stuff, but by
contributing to this project, you grant a world-wide, royalty-free,
perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable license to all users
**under the terms of the license under which this project is
distributed.**

**To track copyright, please use the following:**

**New code file:** At the top of the file, please ensure copyright and
year is attributed to collaborator and assign the full Apache 2.0
license

**Major addition to code file:** ‘Copyright 2015-2023 Province of
British Columbia’ and full Apache 2.0 remains as a header and either the
second collaborator is added if there are changes throughout the code or
copyright is added for specific function(s). So it could read:

``` r
# Copyright 2015-2023 Province of British Columbia
# Copyright 2024 Collaborator
#
#    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
#    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
#    You may obtain a copy of the License at

#    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.
#    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and
#    limitations under the License.
```

or

``` r
# Copyright 2024 Collaborator
# Apache 2.0 License
new_function <- function() {
  # code
} 
```

**Minor changes:** If there are small changes to the code throughout the
file then it may be easiest to leave the copyright declaration
unaltered. However, the contribution will be tracked through GitHub.
