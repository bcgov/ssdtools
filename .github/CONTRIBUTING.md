Government employees, public and members of the private sector are
encouraged to contribute to the repository by **forking and submitting a

(If you are new to GitHub, you might start with a [basic
tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and check out a
more detailed guide to [pull
requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).)

Pull requests will be evaluated by the repository guardians on a
schedule and if deemed beneficial will be committed to the master.

All contributors retain the original copyright to their stuff, but by
contributing to this project, you grant a world-wide, royalty-free,
perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable license to all users
**under the terms of the license under which this project is
distributed.**

**To track copyright, please use the following:**

**New code file:** At the top of the file, please ensure copyright is
attributed to collaborator and assign the Apache 2.0 license

**Major addition to code file:** “Copyright Province of British
Columbia” and Apache 2.0 remains as a header and either the second
collaborator is added if there are changes throughout the code or
copyright is listed for specific lines of code. So it could read:

Copyright Province of British Columbia and Copyright Collaborator Apache
2.0 License

Or

Copyright Province of British Columbia and Lines 200-500 Copyright
Collaborator Apache 2.0 License

**Minor changes:** If there are small changes to the code throughout the
file then it may be easiest to keep these files as Copyright Province of
British Columbia. However, the contribution will be tracked through
GitHub.
