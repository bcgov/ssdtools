# --- TMB-specific Makevars file ---
#
# In principle, TMB model compilation is a completely separate process from
# that of the remainder of 'src'.
# Therefore, other Makevars flags can be added here, e.g.,
#
## CXX_STD = CXX14 # uncomment this line to enable C++14 support
#
# Flags specifically for the TMB compilation can also be set
# through the 'TMB_FLAGS' argument below, e.g.,
#
## TMB_FLAGS = -I"../../inst/include" # add include directory inst/include
#
# --- TMB-specific compiling directives below ---
