Description: Species sensitivity distributions are cumulative probability
    distributions which are fitted to toxicity concentrations for
    different species as described by Posthuma et al.(2001)
    <isbn:9781566705783>.  The ssdtools package uses Maximum Likelihood to
    fit distributions such as the gamma, log-logistic, log-normal and Weibull
    to censored and/or weighted data.
    Multiple distributions can be averaged using Akaike Information Criteria.
    Confidence intervals on hazard concentrations
    and proportions are produced by parametric bootstrapping.
