Title: Species Sensitivity Distributions
Description: Species sensitivity distributions are cumulative probability 
  distributions which are fitted to toxicity concentrations for multiple species.
  The ssdtools package uses Maximum Likelihood to fit
  log-normal, log-logistic, log-Gumbel, Gompertz, gamma or Weibull distributions.
  Multiple distributions can be averaged using Information Criteria.
  Confidence intervals can be calculated for the fitted cumulative distribution 
  function or specific hazard concentrations (percentiles).
  Confidence intervals are currently produced by bootstrapping.
